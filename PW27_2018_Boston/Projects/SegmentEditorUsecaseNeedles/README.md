# Project Description

The superior ability of MR to visualize soft tissue has led to an increase in its use  in guiding percutaneous needle-based interventions such as brachytherapy and biopsy, especially in the human pelvis. A technical challenge associated with the use of MRI imaging in such cases, in contrast to say, CT imaging, is the clear visualization of needles that are inserted into cancerous tissue to either deliver radiation or extract a sample. We have developed algorithms for catheter segmentation and visualization through numerous project weeks [1-3]. In each case, we relied on a custom (editing) tool for creating gold standard segmentations of the needles.  We would like to explore the use of SegmentEditor for this task.  

## Objective

1. Objective. Explore SegmentEditor as an alternative to current manual segmentation of needles in MRI. 

## Approach and Plan

1. Learn how to apply SegmentEditor to  needles in MRI from experts
1. Optimize the workflow. Document it.
1. Use it to segment 500 needles in one day!
